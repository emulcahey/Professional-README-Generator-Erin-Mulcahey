# Professional-README-Generator-Erin-Mulcahey

## Description

This project was made to help the user create a README file for their project by giving them prompts for each section needed. It's not always an easy task to make a README file and it may be helpful to some userser if they had a program that helped in creating a README file. I learned how to create a dialogue between me and a node application that allows for prompts to be asked to the user and answers to be given back to the node application.

## Installation

To use this program, the user will need to:
-Clone this repository. And, open the repository from the installed folder.
-Access the integrated terminal and install npm and node.js to use the repository.
-type 'node index.js' into the integrated terminal.
-type answers to the prompts that the programs gives the user.

## Usage

A user can use this program to help them create a README for their own project. Using this program makes it easier for someone to run through the different parts of a README. Then, once all parts are filled out, it automatically creates a README.md file for them. They can then move the newly created README file to what ever program they created it for.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![Image of the program while answering prompt questions.](Images/answeringQuestions.png)
![Image of the console log that is logged after completing the questions. It gives back the answers.](Images/consoleLogOfAnswers.png)
![Image of the folder with the newly created ReadMe.](Images/folderWithReadMe.png)
![Image of the Preview of the newly created Sample ReadMe.](Images/PreviewOfSampleReadMe.png)
